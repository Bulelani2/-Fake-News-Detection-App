# 📰 Fake News Detection App (Flutter + Django)

A full-stack machine learning application that detects whether a news article is **real or fake**. Built using **Flutter** for the mobile frontend and **Django** with a **scikit-learn** model for the backend API.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📲 **Flutter Frontend**: Clean mobile UI where users input news text to get predictions.
- 🧠 **ML Model (Backend)**: Trained using `SGDClassifier` with `TF-IDF` vectorization on a dataset of labeled fake and real news.
- 🔌 **REST API**: Django REST Framework exposes an endpoint `/api/predict/` that receives a POST request and returns the model prediction.
- 📦 **Preprocessing**: Includes HTML tag removal, stemming, stopword removal, lowercasing, and tokenization.
- ✅ **Accurate Predictions**: 93.7% test accuracy on validation data.

## 🔗 API Usage

**POST** `/api/predict/`  
```json
{
  "text": "Your news article goes here"
}
🌍 Future Improvements
✅ Deploy backend to a cloud server (e.g., Heroku, Railway, Render)

🤖 Replace current model with Deep Learning models like LSTM or BERT

🌐 Integrate web scraping to fetch and classify real-time news

🔁 Enable real-time model re-training with new data
🧠 How It Works
User enters news text in the Flutter app.

Flutter sends a POST request to the Django REST API.

The backend cleans the text and feeds it to a trained ML model.

The model returns a prediction: REAL or FAKE.

The result is displayed in the mobile app UI.
